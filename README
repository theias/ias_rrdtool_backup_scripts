If you want to build this package, you should at least have the following
packages and their dependencies installed:

All systems:
	* fakeroot

Debian:
	* build-essential

Redhat:
	* rpm-build

If you're building from a tag, and the spec file has been put
into the tag, then you can build this on any system that has
package building utilities installed, without fakeroot:

make clean install cp-rpmspec rpmbuild

This will generate a new spec file every time:

fakeroot make clean install rpmspec rpmbuild

To build Debian packages:

fakeroot make clean install debsetup debbuild
